## Changelog
Until this library makes it to a production release of v1.x, **minor versions may contain breaking changes to the API**.  After v1.x, semantic versioning will be honored, and breaking changes will only occur under the umbrella of a major version bump.

- **v0.2.0** - adds TS generic to capture Promise response type (e.g. fetcher().get<MyType>('https://foo.bar.baz'))
- **v0.1.0** - first public release
